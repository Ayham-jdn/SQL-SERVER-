Hotel Reservation Management System

A luxury hotel chain wants to design a database system to handle its
reservations, guests, rooms, and payments efficiently The chain operates
several hotels:
● Each identified by a unique hotel ID, name, star rating, address, city, and contact
number.
● Each hotel has a manager responsible for operations, and every manager is also
recorded in the system as a staff member.

Each hotel contains multiple rooms:
● Every room has a room number unique within that hotel, along with details such as
room type (single, double, suite), capacity, daily rate, and availability status.
● Some rooms may offer additional amenities like sea view, balcony, or kitchen, which
should also be stored.

Guests are the central focus of the system:
● Each guest has a unique guest ID, full name, date of birth, contact details, nationality,
and ID/passport number.
● A guest can make multiple reservations, and some reservations can include more
than one guest (such as families or business groups).

A reservation is made for one or more rooms in a specific hotel:
● It includes details such as reservation ID, check-in date, check-out date, booking date,
number of adults and children, total price, and reservation status (e.g., confirmed,
checked-in, canceled, completed).
● Because guests may share a reservation, the relationship between guests and
reservations must support multiple guests per booking.

Each reservation can have one or more payments associated with it:
● Payments record payment ID, date, amount, method (credit card, cash, online), and
confirmation number.
● Sometimes, a single reservation may be paid in multiple installments, while one
payment may cover multiple reservations if handled by travel agencies.

The hotel also employs several staff members:
● Each identified by a staff ID. For each staff member, the system should record full
name, position (e.g., receptionist, cleaner, manager), salary, and the hotel they work
at.
● Staff can be assigned to assist with multiple reservations — for example, a
receptionist handles check-in/check-out, and a room service staff member may serve
multiple guests.

Additionally, guests may request services during their stay, such as laundry,
spa, or transportation
● Each service request should record a service ID, service name, request date, charge,
and staff member who provided it
● Since one reservation can have many service requests, and staff members can fulfill
requests for many reservations, this relationship must be carefully modeled.
